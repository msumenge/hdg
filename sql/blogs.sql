(1, 'The New Frontier', 'So, hello everybody! Welcome to the first official developer blog for Dyadic! I''m Jack, Creative Director for Handsome Dragon Games, and I''m in charge of all of the design and management aspects of the game, so these developer blogs are my domain. I''ll be putting up a new blog every Friday, so be sure to keep an eye out for them.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nThis week has been one hell of a week on the design front. We''re building this game on top of a ~30 minute demo we made for an exhibition a few weeks back. We''re planning on expanding it to create a two to three hour experience, so that means we need to add several more levels, and to do that, we''ll need several new mechanics to keep them interesting. So, let''s take a look at those, shall we?<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nLet''s start with a staple of the puzzle genre - levers. Hell yes, we''ve got levers. You pull the lever, it''ll activate something. You pull it back, it''ll deactivate that thing. Pretty simple, but immensely useful. Not only does is provide us with new ways of constructing puzzles, but it also serves another useful purpose. Education. The simplicity of levers allows us to communicate one of the key factors of our puzzles: just about everything is binary. It''s on or it''s off, that''s it. So levers are something you can expect to encounter very early in the game, to help you get to grips with everything.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nNext up, we''ve got the elevator, which moves in a way similar to a piston. This handy device is used for moving players and items around the levels, either by lifting them up, or pushing them around. The main purpose of this new mechanic is to create opportunities to expand the level, as well as to give players another puzzle piece to make use of in their escape. One of the benefits of their design, is that they can be used to both help and hinder your partner in the game. Want to get them out of a pit? Activate the elevator and lift them up. Are they trying to pull a lever you don''t want them to? Activate the device and push them away. The possibilities are...not endless, but rather numerous.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=''align''><img src=''https://slack-files.com/files-tmb/T042KS3G1-F04R9NF02-c364cb4146/elevatortease_360.gif''><br/>\r\n<i>The elevator in action. Is it really an elevator if it''s on its side?</i></div><br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nElevators were actually intended to be included in the initial demo of the game, however due to time constraints they were removed very early on. We later discovered that because of that (and a couple of other early removals), all of our mechanics had simply become various ways of opening doors. Which worked, but sounds exceptionally strange when you say it out loud.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nLastly, we''ve got a small collection of mechanics that put together, alter the tone of the game and the player dynamics wildly. All of these mechanics are centred around one other: death. Both players can now be killed by traps in the ruins. Primarily the classic moving walls and descending ceiling traps. And more often than not, it will be up to the other player to save them from that trap. Or not. Neither player is essential to completing each level, so if one dies it''s not the end of the world.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=''align''><img src=''https://slack-files.com/files-tmb/T042KS3G1-F04SDAW0K-34067d40ec/closingwalls_360.gif''><br/>\r\n<i>Don''t worry, they won''t move this fast in the full game.</i></div><br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nThough that''s not to say that there aren''t benefits to having both players alive. Both players co-operating will allow them to access different paths through the level. Paths that are likely going to be easier if they can work together. But these paths will also require you to share the jade statue, your valuable prize, much more freely. Can you really trust your partner with it? That''s up to you to decide.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nHowever, should one of you die whilst working together, worry not, this is not the end of your adventure. A new device has been added, currently dubbed the ''Revival Shrine'', which does what it says on the box. It revives you. If one player is feeling particularly generous, or just wants to have the opportunity to try and kill the other again, they can activate this shrine to revive their partner at a corresponding shrine on their side of the level. But if the two of you can''t manage to work together, again, don''t worry, if you died in a puzzle, you''ll be revived automatically at the start of the next level.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=''align''><img src=''https://slack-files.com/files-tmb/T042KS3G1-F04SJP11V-11b5901c98/it_s_a_monster_360.gif''><br/>\r\n<i>The implementation still isn''t perfect, but you get the idea.</i></div><br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nSo, now you know what to expect from some of the new mechanics we''re bringing to the table. There''s a few more that I haven''t listed here simply because there isn''t room, so they''ll just have to be a surprise. If all goes according to plan, all of our new mechanics will be fully implemented by the end of today and I''ll be putting them into the levels next week. Want to find out how that turns out? Come back next Friday.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nUntil next time,<br/>\r\n-Jack\r\n', '2015-05-14 14:00:00'),
(2, 'Splitting Paths and a Splitting Headache', 'Hello again! Welcome back! It''s time for the second developer blog for Dyadic! For those of you that do not know, I''m Jack, Creative Director for Handsome Dragon Games, and these here blogs? They''re my turf. So now that we''ve cleared that up, let''s get on with it.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nThe last week has been an interesting one to say the least. Majority of the team more or less took the week off to participate in a local game jam called ''Make A Thing'', so this week has primarily been me working on designing and implementing the levels. And I must say, with all these new mechanics and expanded concepts we''ve brought in, level design has become far more complicated than anticipated.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nSo, for example, on the biggest things we''ve been aiming to achieve with the levels and the overall design, is that the players both have the option to work together, or to work only for themselves. As such, one new design that we''ve brought in is split paths. The idea behind this decision was to create situations in which the players could work together and take an easier path through the level, likely at the cost of having to share this priceless relic that they''ve been fighting over. Then, in the same situations, they could decide to either totally screw over, or just generally ignore their partner, and take the solo path. Thus, we create a dynamic wherein the players do not have to rely on each other, but will get benefits if they do (and if they don''t).<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/Screenshot4.png'' width=''100%'' height=''100%''><br/>\r\n<i>Our initial level''s direction with one path per player.</i></div><br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nThis then flows over into the challenge of level design itself. For a start, initially the levels were to be in two distinct sections, one path for each player. However, by offering at least two paths to each player, ideally for majority of the game as well, four paths total must be designed. And to make matters more complicated, on each side of the puzzle, one path must be able to be completed by a single person, whilst the other must require two. The latter is a simple matter, since that''s what I''ve already been doing up to now, I just keep doing that. The former however, is something else entirely.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/Dyadic_Zone_1-1.PNG'' width=''100%'' height=''100%''><br/>\r\n<i>Tutorial levels still make use of the two path system, to get their points across.</i></div><br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nYou see, these mechanics were all initially designed around the idea of having two players interact with them all, and that''s what made it as interesting as it was. Not having the entire puzzle on your side of the level meant you had to think about what you could, but also could not do. Taking these mechanics utilising them in a puzzle for one creates quite a difficult challenge. Primarily because you can activate everything. This means that I need to approach these puzzles in an entirely different way to create something that is still as interesting as the co-op route.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nNow, one particular approach I''m going to look into is emergent puzzles. As it stands, the levels are primarily based around a ''Simon Says'' structure, where there''s a fairly specific order things have to be done in, and it''s up to the player to figure out what that order is. Part of what made the initial use of the ''Simon Says'' more interesting was, as I mentioned early, only having half the puzzle available to any given player. Emergent design, is different in that it''s about there being several ways to solve any given obstacle, and it''s up to the player to decide how they want to go about it. As you might guess, emergent design takes a lot more time and effort than ''Simon Says'', but from it, more interesting results can emerge. I guess we''ll just have to wait and see how it all pans out.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nUntil next time,<br/>\r\nJack', '2015-05-21 14:00:00'),
(3, 'Backhanding Your Friend in the Face', 'Would you look at that? It''s Friday again! That means it''s time for Dyadic''s developer blog number three! As always, I''m Jack, Creative Director for Handsome Dragon Games, and when it comes to developer blogs, I''m the one in charge around here. Got it? Good.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nOver the last week, the game has been undergoing a rather serious metamorphosis. Production itself has had to be more-or-less suspended as we re-evaluate what we really want Dyadic to be, and how exactly we intend to make it that. Things have been added, things have been taken away, things have been changed. We''ve done whatever it takes to make sure this is the game it''s meant to be. Though the process we''ve gone through to get here has not been an easy one.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=''align''><img src=''https://slack-files.com/files-tmb/T042KS3G1-F0515833U-212719ab6b/zone03_01b_720.png'' width=''100%'' height=''100%''><br/>\r\n<i>Some environmental concept art (unrelated to today''s topic).</i></div><br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nFirst and foremost, we had to decide on the kind of experience we wanted to create. We began with a general idea, we wanted a game where players have the option of co-operating and working together, or working purely for themselves and trying to disadvantage their ''partner'' at every opportunity.  Our initial design was aiming for this, and was going about it in a way that focussed heavily on coveting (I need that statue), bargaining (give me the statue and I''ll stop the trap), and betrayal (I''ll get you killed now so the statue is mine).<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nNow, coveting and betrayal are some pretty heavy things to try to facilitate in a couch co-op kind of game. After much discussion, we decided we wanted it to be much more playful, akin to Magicka, Battle Block Theatre, or the latest Super Mario 3D World. All of these games put players together in a co-operative campaign but give them ample opportunity to mess with each other. Magicka lets you attack friendly players with same spells you''d use on enemies (usually accidentally...at first anyway), Battle Block Theatre lets you offer your friend a helping hand, only to withdraw it at the last second and leave them falling to their death. And then there''s Super Mario 3D world.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nSuper Mario 3D is a game that lets you throw friends off the edge of the stage, collide with them mid-jump (possibly killing you both), or steal EVERY. SINGLE. POWER-UP. And then there''s the crown. A literal golden crown awarded to the player who earns the most points in each level, which can then be stolen from that player in every subsequent level. Wearing the crown at the end of a level awards a large sum of extra points, making it more likely for that player to earn the crown again for the next level, and making the crown even more valuable. Let me tell you, working so hard to earn that crown and then having it stolen from you within moments of starting a level? It''s the kind of thing that makes you want to backhand your friend in the face. With vigour.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nSo, what is it about these games that we want to achieve so much? They allow players to compete without having to put them in direct opposition (something we''d been trying to do). The players are still always working towards their co-operative end goal, but they have plenty of opportunities to screw each other over. And it''s not mandatory for them to disadvantage each other; they are perfectly capable of playing the game fully co-operatively. But I think we can all agree, it''s much more fun with a little bit of competition. And that''s why we want to make our game this way. So people can have fun playing together, but get that mischievous thrill of screwing over your friends.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nAnd so, we come to the other important question, how do we intend to do it? Our current designs, which may very well change in the future, are to significantly increase the type and number of traps throughout the ruins, and to make none of them automatically activate. All activation is done by the other player. So it''s completely up to the other player is help you advance, and also to try and kill you. Depending on how they''re feeling. What''s more though, is that many traps will only activate once, so if you miss...it''s going to become very awkward. This means if you intend to mess with your partner, you''d best plan ahead and get your timing right.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nBut, that''s enough rambling for today. With any luck, we should have these designs locked down exactly sometime next week and can get right back into the swing of things. The game''s going in a somewhat different direction from where it started, but I think we''re really onto something here. As to whether or not my thinking is correct...only time will tell. Time and ridiculous amount of playtesting.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nUntil next time,<br/>\r\nJack\r\n\r\n', '2015-05-28 14:00:00'),
(4, 'A Fine Balance', 'Hello yet again, dearest readers. It seems it is time once more for our weekly developer blog. Now, some of you may notice that is blog isn''t up on Friday like the rest. So I''d like to take a moment to inform you that our developer blog schedule has changed slightly, so we will now be updating it every Sunday, rather than every Friday so we may better discuss the work we''ve done. Now that that''s out of the way, I should introduce myself. I''m Jack, Creative Director for Handsome Dragon Games, and I''m the dedicated writer for all these here blogs. Let''s get on with it, shall we?<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nThis week our main focus as a team has been getting all of the new traps in the game and integrated into the levels, which is progressing rather nicely. Now, I can''t necessarily speak for the programming side of things, but when it comes to designing levels with these traps as well it presents a number of new challenges (as do most significant changes). The key difference now that traps have been added, is trying to find a balance between puzzles and traps.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=''align''><img src=''https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T042KS3G1-F061W7XJL/arrow_trap.gif''><br/>\r\n<i>The ''Arrow Trap'' in action.</i></div><br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nInitially, when the game was in its very early stages, the all of our mechanics were centred purely around puzzles. There was no death in the game whatsoever. This meant level design was much more straight forward as it was simply about designing spaces that did two things: challenge the player''s ability to think, and give them opportunities to fight over the statue. These spaces could then easily be strung together to create cohesive levels. However, the addition of traps now adds more objectives to the design of these spaces.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=''align''><img src=''https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T042KS3G1-F061VUB9D/rock_trap.gif''><br/>\r\n<i>Surprise! Giant stone slab!</i></div><br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nNaturally, these spaces must now not only challenge the players'' cognitive abilities, but also give the players opportunities to kill each other, in dastardly mischievous ways. Catapult your friend into lava? Drop a slab of stone on them? Open the trapdoor they''re standing on? The possibilities are, well, not endless, but quite substantial I''d say. This in turn, does help achieve the objective of creating opportunities to fight over the statue, which is a nice bonus. Still, the extra challenges remain.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=''align''><img src=''https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T042KS3G1-F061VKL2J/catapult_trap2.gif''><br/>\r\n<i>A device we have dubbed ''The Catapult Pad''. It has a whole range of uses.</i></div><br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nSo, we need to achieve different things in a given space using both the puzzle pieces and the traps, and this is where the new challenges arise. You see, both the puzzle pieces and the traps take up space. As such, we can only have so many of each in a given area. This means it''s important to find a balance between the two. We don''t want the game to always be nothing but a trap run, where puzzles are an occasional hindrance, but much the same we don''t want the traps to be too rare either. Therein lies the main challenge, finding the balance between puzzles and traps.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nNow, the time has come to stop talking about this theory and return to putting it into practice. If all goes roughly according to plan, these levels will be fully designed within a week, at which point their construction within the game shall begin. Once construction is complete, playtesting can begin and it is then that we shall see if I have managed to find a proper balance of puzzles and traps. Until then, we can only wait.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nUntil next time,<br/>\r\nJack\r\n', '2015-06-06 14:00:00'),
(5, 'By A Process of Implementation...\r\n', 'Once again, the time for the developer blog has arisen, and once again I am here to provide you with the blog that you desire. Who am I? I am Jack, Creative Director for Handsome Dragon Games, and I''m here writing these developer blogs every Sunday, just for you.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nSo, this week it''s been all about moving from the design stages of the levels to the implementation stages. The brilliant programmers (Corey, Callan, and Jared) have finished implementing all of our new trap mechanics and I''ve now brought several of them into our first showcase level for Greenlight.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nNow, this level has been going through quite the transformation, as all levels do throughout the development process. It began as merely a design, roughly scrawled onto my whiteboard. This point is all about getting the puzzles themselves designed and determining the general flow of a level. The whiteboard adds a nice bonus of being able to immediately change any decisions in a matter of moments, so you can experiment with greater freedom.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=''align''><img src=''http://handsomedragongames.com/images/5/1.jpg'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''><br/>\r\n<i>Make sense? It probably shouldn''t.</i></div><br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nBut a design is only worth so much, and you can''t play the game on a whiteboard. So then it moves onto the second stage, implementation. Our levels all go through three implementation phases. The first is construction. This is where using the design, the level itself is built. The shape of the terrain is laid out, the puzzle pieces and traps are arrayed around the level, and everything is built so as to be playable, start to finish. This is the point where the level is functional, but exceptionally bare and unappealing.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=''align''><img src=''http://handsomedragongames.com/images/5/2.png'' width=''100%'' height=''100%''><br/>\r\n<i>The end of the first Greenlight level.</i></div><br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nThe next phase is the connection phase. This is where I do another pass of the level and add all of the visual connections between the puzzle pieces. Now, this may not seem like a massive improvement, the level still looks bare and is only marginally less ugly than before. However, the addition of connectors means that there is a clear indication of what activates what within the level. This means that at this stage we can begin playtesting, before moving on to the final phase.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=''align''><img src=''http://handsomedragongames.com/images/5/3.png'' width=''100%'' height=''100%''><br/>\r\n<i>The end of the first Greenlight level, now with some connectors!</i></div><br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nLastly, comes the aesthetics phase. The level works and can be tested, so it''s time to make it look nice. So that means we add decorations, background objects, lighting, particle effects, shaders, everything. We do whatever we can to make the level look as appealing and atmospheric as possible. And it makes a huge difference. It takes a level from this:<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=''align''><img src=''http://handsomedragongames.com/images/5/4.png'' width=''100%'' height=''100%''><br/>\r\n><i>The initial prototype level, before aesthetics.</i></div><br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nTo this:<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=''align''><img src=''http://handsomedragongames.com/images/5/5.png'' width=''100%'' height=''100%''><br/>\r\n<i>The initial prototype level, after aesthetics.</i></div><br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nNow, the first Greenlight level has just been through the connection phase, so it''s just about ready for testing (once a couple more bugs get ironed out). Whilst that''s underway, not only will I be working on its aesthetics, but also going through the implementation process again for the other designs I have in store. How those designs turn out is, as always, something we will have to wait and see.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nUntil next time,<br/>\r\nJack\r\n', '2015-06-13 14:00:00'),
(6, 'Back In The Swing Of Things', 'And so Sunday has come around again. This means that, yet again, it is time for the developer blog. I''m Jack, Creative Director for Handsome Dragon Games, and I''m the one responsible for all of these blogs. I''ll be here every Sunday, writing more and more content for your enjoyment. So without further ado, let''s get right to it.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nThis last week has been one filled with all kinds of achievements. So this week, the blog isn''t going to be focussing on any particular topic, just showcasing all the various things that we''ve got working in the game now, and sharing some insight on those particular aspects of the project. We''ve got all kinds of things this week, from level design to physics simulation.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nFirst up, the area I know best, level design. The first Greenlight showcase level now has its first layer of aesthetics. This means it''s now gone from looking like this:<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=''align''><img width=''50%'' height=''50%'' src=''https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67186245/Dyadic/Pics/Room%20G-1%20With%20Connectors.PNG ''></div><br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nTo this:<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=''align''><img width=''50%'' height=''50%''  src=''https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67186245/Dyadic/Pics/G-1%20with%20Aesthetics.PNG ''></div><br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nA marked improvement, to be sure. If you recall last week''s development blog, aesthetics is the final stage of the levels development, so that level is very close to being complete! Play-testing notwithstanding, that is.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>There''s even more on the level design front, because now our second Greenlight showcase level is nearly done as well! This level was divided into two halves, one of which is also at the aesthetics stage of the process.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=''align''><img width=''50%'' height=''50%''  src=''https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67186245/Dyadic/Pics/G-2A.PNG''></div><br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nNow, unfortunately, we''ve still got a lot of art work to do, to bring Dyadic''s visuals to their full potential. For the time being, you may have noticed there''s still a fair amount of placeholder art in our levels, like this.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=''align''><img width=''50%'' height=''50%''  src=''https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67186245/Dyadic/Pics/THE%20BIRD.PNG ''><br/>\r\n<i>There''s a reason why Jared is a programmer, not an artist.</i></div><br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nBut not to worry, before too long, our final art will be coming together and the levels will be looking better than ever.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nLast, but hardly least, our ever excellent programmer Corey has created an amazing physics system for 2D liquid. Now, I''m not going to pretend I know how it works, but I do know what it does. You take a normally flat plane of liquid, and drop an object in it. This creates all kinds of ripples in reaction to the force of that object falling. Like so.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=''align''><img width=''50%'' height=''50%''  src=''https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T042KS3G1-F06KN084C/tryhardlava9001.gif''></div><br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nAnd the best part is, by simply modifying a few values, you can create a simulation of all kinds of different liquids. Like water.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=''align''><img width=''50%'' height=''50%''  src=''https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67186245/Dyadic/Pics/Water.gif ''><br/>\r\n<i>Like water.</i></div><br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=''align''><img width=''50%'' height=''50%''  src=''https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67186245/Dyadic/Pics/Custard.gif ''><br/>\r\n<i>Custard.</i></div><br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=''align''><img width=''50%'' height=''50%''  src=''https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T042KS3G1-F06KN084C/tryhardlava9001.gif''><br/>\r\n<i>Or boiling Kool-Aid.</i></div><br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nThe possibilities are practically endless.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nSo there you have it, another week in the life of Dyadic.

(8, 'A Touch of Art, A Touch of Warmth', 'Heyo! And welcome, yet again, to this weeks'' Dyadic developer blog! As per usual, I''m Jack, Creative Director for Handsome Dragon Games, here to give you the low down on what''s been happening. This week is all about art, because we''ve got a whole lot more now. And, spoiler alert, it looks great.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nSo now that we''ve got all of these fantastic visual pieces ready to go into the game, I''ve been dedicating my time to doing another aesthetic pass of all the Greenlight levels, so naturally they''re looking better than ever! Let''s take a look at some of the new art we''ve got and make a few placeholder comparisons.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nFirstly, the humble lever. At first it was nothing more than a column squeezed onto a button base, but now it has its own style. And it actually looks comfortable to pull too.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=''align''><img width=''25%'' height=''25%'' src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/Lever_Art_Old.PNG''><img width=''25%'' height=''25%'' src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/Lever_Art.PNG''><br/>\r\n<i>Placeholder lever (left) VS Current lever (right)</i></div><br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nNext up, the moving platform. Once just a simple black bar, now a fully mechanised wonder of engineering.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=''align''><img width=''25%'' height=''25%'' src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/Platform_Art_Old.PNG''><img width=''25%'' height=''25%'' src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/Moving_Platform_Art.PNG''><br/>\r\n<i>Placeholder platform (left) VS Current platform (right)</i></div><br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nAnd let''s not forget our old friend, the bird. It''s still a bird. We don''t actually have any new art for it yet.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=''align''><img width=''25%'' height=''25%'' src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/THE_BURD.PNG''><br/>\r\n<i>The bird. Jared still isn''t an artist.</i></div><br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nBut it''s not just new art for mechanics that we''ve got this week. We''ve got a whole host of new decorations for the game.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=''align''><img width=''25%'' height=''25%'' src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/Pots_Art.PNG''><br/>\r\n<i>Like pots.</i></div><br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=''align''><img width=''25%'' height=''25%'' src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/Pipes_Art.PNG''><br/>\r\n<i>Pipes.</i></div><br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=''align''><img width=''25%'' height=''25%'' src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/Pillar_Art.PNG''><br/>\r\n<i>Pillars</i></div><br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=''align''><img width=''25%'' height=''25%'' src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/Shrine_Art.PNG''><br/>\r\n<i>Places of potential worship.</i></div><br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=''align''><img width=''25%'' height=''25%'' src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/Debris_Art.PNG''><br/>\r\n<i>And debris.</i></div><br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nThis week, we''ve got it all. Bringing it all together really gives the levels a feeling that is much warmer and more ''alive'', so to speak.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=''align''><img width=''25%'' height=''25%'' src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/G-2_End.PNG''><br/>\r\n<i>Here''s the level (well, some of it) in all its current glory.</i></div><br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nAnd that''s a look at this weeks'' art. Now as you''ve probably guess, there''s still plenty of art left to be done. But it''ll all be here soon enough. And when it is, you can be sure you''ll find me showing it off right here. So make sure you come back then, okay?<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nUntil next time,<br/>\r\nJack\r\n', '2015-07-04 14:00:00'),
(9, 'Power To The Players\r\n', 'Welcome, welcome, once again to this week''s Dyadic developer blog! As always, I''m Jack, Creative Director for Handsome Dragon Games, and I''m here to fill you in on all the important happenings of the past week. Well, all the important happenings about Dyadic anyway.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nThe key feature that I''ll be ranting about this week is the Level Editor. As one might expect, this feature is designed to allow players to take all of our assets and mechanics, and use them to create their own levels in-game. Should our Greenlight prove successful, we''ll also be combining this feature with the Steam Workshop so that players can then share their designs with the world! Now, it''s still primarily conceptual, and only in the early stages of implementation, so I''m going to be giving you a run through of how it''s set to work.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, we''re going to be giving players access to every resource we have. All of these will be accessible through various categories on the right. Clicking these objects or dragging them into the scene will add them to the level.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/objectselectandmoveinscene.png'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''><br/>\r\n<i>A basic concept of the editor.</i></div><br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nFrom there, it''s pretty straight forward. As you''d expect, you can move the objects up, down, left, and right, spin them this way and that, and make them as large or as small as you desire. This world is yours.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/settingsmenu.png'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''><br/>\r\n<i>Need more options? One menu slides away as another slides out, leaving you room to work.</i></div><br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nBeyond that, you''ll have the freedom to connect any trap or device to any activator. Want to have a door that only opens when seventeen different buttons are pressed? You got it. Want to have one lever activate three arrow traps, two elevators, and a trapdoor? Sure thing. You want that button to do absolutely nothing? Well, if you say so...<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/level_editor_1.png'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''><br/>\r\n<i>Like I said, implementation is still in the early stages.</i></div><br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nThrough all of this, we hope to create an opportunity for players to both make and experience potentially infinite new content for the game (with the added benefit of not having to make it ourselves). Now, this Level Editor is a fairly recent addition to the project, so it was not included when planning out our initial timeframe. As such, there is sadly no guarantee that it will be in the game at launch. However, should that be the case, we will be adding it to the game in an update after our initial release.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nSo, have I set the gears in your mind turning, creating all manner of grand and complex puzzles and mechanisms? Maybe not, but you''ll be sure to hear more about the Level Editor as it progresses, so not to worry, you''ll get there. But that''s well into the future, so as usually, we''ll have to wait and see how it all turns out.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nUntil next time,<br/>\r\nJack', '2015-07-11 14:00:00'),
(10, 'As We Approach The Horizon', 'Hey there! Welcome back! As always, Sunday has come around again which means it''s time for Dyadic''s developer blog! As ever, I am Jack, Creative Director for Handsome Dragon Games, and my job here is to keep you up to date with what''s been going on.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>This week, I''ll be looking at a few different areas and where they''re all at. With our Greenlight debut fast approaching, we''ve got all systems in overdrive at the moment, getting everything ready. As such, we''ve got all kinds of new stuff to show from levels, to art, to programming. So, shall we begin?\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>As you might expect, I''ll be starting with the area that I''m most familiar with: the levels. We''ve now got the last of our Greenlight showcase levels in the game! This weekend it''s gone through all of the various stages of level design (that I ranted about several weeks back, if you''re interested); from the terrible whiteboard drawing all the way to in-game aesthetics. Although the aesthetics still have a little more work to go, it''s nearly there!\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/G-3.PNG'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''>\r\n<br/><i>There''s still some more decorating to go, to fill out the space, but it''s getting there.</i></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>This level is quite different to the others. Here''s where we''re really showing off the puzzle side of things. The challenges are far more complex and interconnected than the previous two levels, and will require a lot more working together. To help with that, I''ve gone a little lighter on the traps as well.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Next up, we''ve got new art, and it looks as spectacular as always. Our artist Angelica''s primary focus as of late has been on traps. This week we''ve got some new art for both the trapdoor, and some awesome art for a trap dubbed the "Crusher Piston". Guess what that does.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/Trapdoor.png'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''>\r\n<br/><i>You can already see the ominous glow of the lava below...</i></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/Crusher_Concept.png'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''>\r\n<br/><i>The art isn''t fully completed, but still looks incredibly imposing.</i></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Furthermore, we''ve got ourselves an icon for our Greenlight listing! Again, this is Angelica''s fine handiwork. Even though it''s pretty eye-catching already, be sure to keep an eye out for it in the coming weeks! We wouldn''t want you to miss it!\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/Dyadic_Icon.png'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''>\r\n<br/><i>This is it! Don''t miss it!</i></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Lastly, on the programming side of things, it''s been a week of reshaping, reworking, and rewriting a number of systems. These things include mirrors, and elevators, amongst others. Now, for the most part, these aren''t thing you''ll explicitly notice as a player because you don''t get to see the code itself, but there is at least one cool new thing you can see...\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/aahhgggmirros.gif'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''>\r\n<br/><i>It still needs a couple of tweaks, but it''s still cool, right?</i></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>And that''s everything for this week! Our deadline is getting ever closer, but we''re just about ready for Greenlight! We''re going to be putting extra effort in these last couple of weeks to make sure we''re fully prepared, so I''ll likely have lots to tell you about next week. What all that stuff is exactly? You''ll just have to wait and see.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Until next time,\r\n<br/>Jack\r\n', '2015-07-18 14:00:00'),
(11, 'Another Week In The Life of Dyadic', 'Hey there, and welcome yet again to Dyadic''s weekly developer blog! As always, I''m Jack, Creative Director for Handsome Dragon Games, and I''m here to fill you in on what''s been happening over the last week. With our Greenlight debut coming up on Friday (July 31st), it''s been a busy week. Much like last week, there''s been a lot going on in a number of different areas, so let''s go through them one by one.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Firstly, we have the levels. This week we''ve all been running through the levels and making all kinds of adjustments. I''ve been working on making the levels more appealing by adding more detail to the environment, whilst the programmers have been thoroughly testing their various mechanics in the levels for any stray bugs we may have missed earlier. Additionally, I''ve been revitalising some of our older levels and updating them to fit with our new mechanics and themes. Whilst they''ve still got a ways to go, they''re coming along nicely.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/G-3_With_Details.PNG'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''>\r\n<br/><i>he faded detailing on the walls is another layer of aesthetics the levels now feature.</i></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/E-3.PNG'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''>\r\n<br/><i>Fun fact: This level was originally meant to be part of the first prototype, but was cut early because it made the prototype far too long. It must be challenging!</i></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Next up, we''ve got some more new art. Art for the crusher, the revival shrine, the trapdoor, and the falling stone slab all have finalised art! And I must say, our artist <a href=''https://endziz.wordpress.com/''>Angelica</a> has done an exceptional job (as always)! We''ve even got several colour variations of some for the game''s different zones.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/Crusher_Variations.PNG'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''>\r\n<br/><i>This thing looks even more imposing now it''s finished.</i></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/Shrine.PNG'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''>\r\n<br/><i>These things are fuelled by some kind of arcane magic that won''t let you die (well, they won''t let you stay dead, at least). Best make good use of them!</i></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/Slab_Variations.PNG'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''>\r\n<br/><i>A mechanism much more primitive than the crusher, but equally deadly.</i></div>\r\n<br/>\r\nLastly, we''ve got all of our programmers efforts. <a href=''https://coreyunderdown.wordpress.com/''>Corey</a>, <a href=''https://callansyratt.wordpress.com/''>Callan</a>, and <a href=''https://jaredford94.wordpress.com/''>Jared</a> have all been working hard to iron out any bugs and errors they can find within the game. Unfortunately, most of this stuff isn''t something you notice within screenshots, so there''s not much I can show you. But rest assured, thanks to their efforts the game is running better than ever now.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>So, that''s another week in the life of Dyadic. Now we just need to properly collate all of our game footage and images to get ourselves ready of Greenlight. Don''t forget, we''ll be up there on July 31st! Do us all a favour and give a thumbs up!\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Until next time,\r\n<br/><a href=''https://jkuskoff.wordpress.com/''>Jack</a>\r\n', '2015-07-25 14:00:00'),
(12, 'Greenlight Is Go!', 'Hey there you Handsome Readers! Nice of you to stop by. This week has been quite the thrill ride, especially considering that <a href=''http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=491366195''>Dyadic is now up on Greenlight!</a> Oh, but where are my manners? I''m Jack, Creative Director for Handsome Dragon Games, and this is the HDG developer blog. I''m here to tell you all about where we''re at and where we''re going. So let''s get to it.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>As I previously mentioned, as of July 31st <a href=''http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=491366195''>Dyadic is on Steam Greenlight!</a> This means that right now you can head over there and vote to get our game on Steam! Or you can vote to not have it on Steam, if that''s how you feel I guess... But regardless, we''re already well on our way to the top 100, but we can always use your help as well to get there!\r\nNow, the  fact that we''re on Greenlight means that we''ve been making a lot of progress on the game lately. Our various Greenlight levels are all ''prettied up'' and functional. We''ve been getting in new art and sound effects too. And of course, we''ve been stomping bugs like there''s no tomorrow.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>First as always, the levels. Over the past week I''ve been working to make sure that the various Greenlight levels are looking as good as they can. Beyond that, I''ve also been making any necessary adjustments to the puzzle logic and layout of the rooms to ensure that it''s as hard as possible for the players to reach a state in which the puzzle has become unsolvable.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/G2_Example.PNG'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''>\r\n<br/><i>It may not be obvious to see, but it''s better now. Honest...</i></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Additionally, I''ve also dusted off an old level from the prototype that we abandoned long ago because the game was already too long without it. Having gone back into it, I didn''t realise just how early we cut it out, and just how much better we''ve become at putting levels together. But, nonetheless, I''ve been doing it up and it''s starting to get the life back in its eyes. There''s still a fair way to go though.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/E-3.1.PNG'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''>\r\n<br/><i>This level is so old, we were still using an orange background.</i></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>We''ve also got all of our core art assets now too! That means every trap and mechanic looks like it''s meant to. So we''ve gone from this...\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/THE_BURD.PNG'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''>\r\n<br/><i>Jared was never an artist...and may never be.</i></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>To this...\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/Dragon_Trap.gif'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''>\r\n<br/><i>Even the fire itself was skillfully crafted by Angelica''s hand.</i></div>\r\n<br/>Quite the improvement, since Jared still isn''t an artist (much to his dismay, I''m sure). Beyond that we''ve also got art for the arrow traps and the spear traps as well. Finally, all the placeholder art has been removed!\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Our ever excellent musician, Sam, has also taken the time to create a host of new sound effects for the all the new mechanics that we''ve implemented. Before too long, we''ll be getting some new music too to go with our new environments in the various zones. For now though, here''s a few of the more impressive sounds effects we''re using.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/><div class=''align''><i>Player Death</i><br/><audio controls><source src=''/audio/PlayerDeath2.mp3'' type=''audio/mpeg''>Your browser doesn''t support audio elements sorry!</audio>\r\n<br/><i>Revival</i><br/><audio controls><source src=''/audio/Rvival.mp3'' type=''audio/mpeg''>Your browser doesn''t support audio elements sorry!</audio>\r\n<br/><i>Statue Slot</i><br/><audio controls><source src=''/audio/StatueSlot.mp3'' type=''audio/mpeg''>Your browser doesn''t support audio elements sorry!</audio></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Lastly, our programmers have been working diligently to remove any flaws or bugs we can find, as well as implement a few new features. For example, upon death, the player''s ''spirit'' will actually fly to the appropriate revival shrine before the player respawns. It''s little things like this that really help bring the game to life.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/Respawn_Gif_Gif.gif'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''>\r\n<br/><i>It''s not quite perfect, but it''s getting there.</i></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>But, that''s enough rambling for today. Now you know where we are, and hopefully have some idea of where we''re going. And don''t forget, <a href=''http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=491366195''>you can vote for us on Greenlight</a>  at this very moment. So please do be sure to do so, if you''d be so kind. Hopefully, with your assistance, we''ll be through in no time. But, I guess that''s something we''ll just have to wait and see.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Until next time,\r\n<br/>Jack\r\n', '2015-08-01 14:00:00');

Sadly, we''ve got very little to report for the game itself. That''s because this week we''ve been out doing interviews and live streams and all kinds of stuff!\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/8andhalfBit.jpg'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Firstly, to kick the week off, we (Callan, Corey, and myself) had a chat with James and Paul of the Eight and a Half Bit podcast. We spent a good half hour talking about games, insulting James, and generally goofing around. Oh, and I think Dyadic came up in there somewhere too. The podcast isn''t up just yet, but when it is, we''ll probably update this blog so you can find it.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/5-83.png'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Follow that, Dyadic was also featured on a livestream, hosted by 6T4 Bites. These lucky people spent three hours playing and breaking our game, and (as far as I could tell) having a lot of fun too.

I don''t want to spoil too much about this one either, so if you want to see some gameplay and some bugs, you can check it out here.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/sae_qantm_logo.png'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Lastly, Corey, Callan, Sam, and myself all spent our Saturday in the city for SAE''s Open Day! SAE is where we''re all studying, if you didn''t already know. Naturally, we had Dyadic on display for the public to enjoy, which no doubt convinced several people that studying at SAE was the right choice, even if I do say so myself. We were going to get some photos of us at the event to show off here, but...we forgot. Hopefully SAE will post some of their own soon that we can steal to put here.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>And that was our week! We spent so much time out and about talking to people that we didn''t really get much time to do anything noteworthy with the game itself.

Our appreciation is truly immeasurable.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/internal_scream.png'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''>\r\n<br/><i>Needless to say, we''re pretty excited about it all.</i></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>The campaign itself went exceptionally well. Dyadic was Greenlit only 14 days after we first submitted it! A two week turnaround was certainly faster than any of us expected. Additionally, with over 2000 unique views, we managed to get over 600 votes in our favour!  Which may not seem that impressive, but our percentage of ''Yes'' votes was slightly higher than the average percentage for the top 100 games on Greenlight, so there''s that! Again, the whole process went even better than we''d imagined! Thanks once more to all of you who helped!\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/Final_GL_Stats.png'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''>\r\n<br/><i>Again, it may not look fantastic, but surprisingly it''s better than average.</i></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Other than that, over the last week I''ve also been looking into the required processes to officially turn Handsome Dragon Games into its own company. Complete with shares, directors, and piles of incomprehensible legal jargon. ''Fun'' is one of the last words I''d use to describe the process, but necessary is one of the first. I won''t bore you with the details, but the game''s production may be slowed a little over the coming weeks as we sort all of this out.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Oh, speaking of game production, some stuff also happened with that! It''s almost like that''s the kind of stuff this blog is supposed to talk about... Anyway, it''s mostly just lots of minor tweaks, adjustments, and bug fixed. One particular fix of note though is the infamous laser mirrors. Now, I''m not sure if they''re perfect, but at the very least we haven''t managed to break them. Yet.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Now that the big announcement out of the way along with all that other stuff, I''ve got another announcement for you. We''re going to be taking a short break from Dyadic, for only a couple of weeks. So, I can''t promise any updates, unless there''s something significant to update you all on. Now, no doubt you''re wondering why we''re taking this break. To put it simply, we don''t have the time. Our trimester is coming to a close in the next couple of weeks and we need to make sure all our other games are up to scratch before they''re submitted. I do hope you understand.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/Gangnam_Platform.gif'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''>\r\n<br/><div>An excellent dance, but irritating bug.</i></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>But, not to worry! We''ll be back before you know it, and we should have a demo ready for you within a month! I know a month may seem like a long time, but those ''Gangnam Platforms'' are proving to be far more troublesome than we''d expected. That, and we''re taking that two week break I mentioned.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Until we return,\r\n<br/>Jack \r\n', '2015-08-15 14:00:00'),
(15, 'Back In Action', 'Why hello there! Finally, it''s that time again: The weekly Dyadic Devlog. I''m Jack, Creative Director for Handsome Dragon Games, and we''re finally off hiatus and back to getting Dyadic done. This week, we''ve got some important news for you! So let''s get to it.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Obviously, let''s start with the important news. The demo is nearly ready to go! We''ve even decided on a date that you and a friend will be able to get hands on with Dyadic itself. Well, if you can find a friend. I''m sure you''ll manage.  Anyway, the point is that the demo will be available on the 18th of August! I''m not sure when it''ll be out on the 18th though, so maybe check in on the 19th, just to be sure.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/Demo_Calendar.png'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''>\r\n<br/><i>Be sure to mark it down!</i></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Beyond that this first week back has been...not uneventful, but not exactly interesting I would say. Naturally, all of our efforts are going into making sure that the demo is as polished and ready as it can be for when it finds its way into your assuredly eager hands. This means that our week has been devoted to more tweaking and bugs fixing. Our primary goals this week have been to find probable causes and possible solutions to all the various bugs and issues that plague us.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/Gangnam_Platform.1.gif'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''>\r\n<br/><i>One of the many things we must resolve.</i></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>And whilst we''ve certainly been making progress, there''s not much for us to show. One of our largest focuses though has been optimisation - a process by which we alter the code and other game systems to reduce the amount of computing power the game requires to function as much as possible. We''ve discovered that animations are one of the largest problems here. For one reason or another they''re taking a lot of power to process. We''re still not sure why, to be honest, but we''ll have it sorted soon, without doubt.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/THE_BIRD.1.PNG'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''>\r\n<br/><i>Unfortunately, it is impossible to optimise The Burd any further.</i></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>And that''s pretty much all of it for this week. Again, don''t forget that the Dyadic Demo will be available August 18th, at some point. Be sure to try it out! It is free, after all.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Until next time,\r\n<br/>Jack', '2015-09-05 14:00:00'),
(16, 'We made a thing', 'Hey there, you Handsome reader! Once again Sunday rolls around as inevitably as the heat-death of the universe, if the heat-death of the universe happened on a weekly basis, which means it''s time for a devlog! As always, I''m Jack, Creative Director for Handsome Dragon Games, and this week we''ve made a thing. However, this thing is not Dyadic. We''ve been working on Dyadic too though, so don''t you worry.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>First things first, let''s cover what you came here for - Dyadic. We''ve recently been playing around with some new art concepts for revamping the game''s background visuals, as well as the overall aesthetics for the various zones in the game, Zone 1 in particular. So for example, we''re working on making Zone 1 look more run-down and temple-ish. We''ve also got some other interesting ideas in the works for the final zone, but we''ll be keeping them a secret for now (and possibly forever).\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/depth.JPG'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''>\r\n<br/><i>Here you can see both the zone and background ideas.</i></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>On the topic of things you can look at, we''ve also redone the visuals on the main menu to make them look a bit more complete. Additionally, we''ve added graphics options to the main menu (so now you can change them after launch), as well as a new loading screen across the entire game.  These may not seem like big things, but they do make a difference to the overall experience, I assure you.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/Main_Menu.PNG'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''>\r\n<br/><i>The statue''s glow also gently pulses now, which is nice.</i></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Now that that''s out of the way, some not strictly Dyadic related news. Over the last week, four of the six members of Handsome Dragon Games (Corey, Callan, Sam, and myself) participated in the "Make A Thing" 40 hour game jam. Needless to say, we did indeed make a ''thing'', or a game, to be more specific. To get really specific, we made LinKeR, a four player, top-down, twin-stick racing game. Whilst it primarily plays like your typical arcade racer type of game, the key difference is that every player is linked to another player that acts as their ''scapegoat'' (one of the *WORD* words). This means that when Player A gets hit, Player B takes the damage.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/Yakuza_Wins.PNG'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''>\r\n<br/><i>We always wanted YDM to win, because his win theme was the best one.</i>\r\n<br/><iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/223363321&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Admittedly, we didn''t get the game anywhere near as finished as we''d have liked, but we did manage to walk away with the award for "Best Game Art". This was particularly surprising since our artist hadn''t participated in the event, so all the artwork was done by yours truly. But anyway, regardless of where it ended up, we''re currently pretty enthused by the game''s concept, so we''re thinking of possibly working on it as HDG''s next project after Dyadic. Though that''s a fair way away now, so we''ll see.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Anyway, I''ve rambled on enough I think. So that''s been another week in the development of Dyadic, and also the development of not Dyadic. And don''t forget, the Dyadic demo will be out THIS FRIDAY THE 18th! Make sure you don''t miss it!\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Until next time,\r\n<br/>Jack', '2015-09-12 14:00:00'),
(17, 'Come On And Try It!', 'Why, hello there, you Handsome looking reader! So nice of you to join us. I''m your host, Jack, Creative Director for Handsome Dragon Games, and as always, I''m here to keep you up to date with the ins and outs of Dyadic''s development. This week we''ve hit another big milestone, the demo! That''s right, we''ve got a demo out right now, ready and waiting for you to give it a try! But it''s not something that just came together overnight, we''ve been adding and adjusting all kinds of things to get it ready.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>First and foremost, our fantastic UI programmer (and PR specialist), Callan, has completely reworked all of the game''s menus and interfaces. So this means we now have a whole host of new art and animations for all the various aspects of the menus; the art being done by Angelica, of course. So, now our main menu looks like this:\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/Main_Menu.1.PNG'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''>\r\n<br/><i>Isn''t it beautiful?</i></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>A significant improvement over the previous version. Additionally, these interface updates improved the pause menu, improved the options menu, added a loading screen, and added several splash screens, to name a few. Unfortunately, we haven''t had the time to make the splashes skip-able, but don''t worry, there''s only a couple.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/Loading.gif'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''>\r\n<br/><i>They''re never going to stop fighting over that thing. Never.</i></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Beyond this, the game now supports all three control schemes! This means you can now play using the traditional ''2 on 1'' style, where you and your partner share the same controller; ''2 on 2'', where you and your partner each have your own controller because you can''t stand the thought of having to be physically close to each other; or keyboard controls, where the two of you will use different ends of the same keyboard. Now that these have been implemented by Jared, it means that anyone can play, regardless of if they have a controller or not! Well, anyone on a Windows machine anyway, Mac and Linux aren''t quite working yet, unfortunately.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/Control_Scheme.PNG'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''>\r\n<br/><i>Let''s be honest, ''2 on 1'' will always be the best choice.</i></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>I myself have been going through the levels and tweaking all kinds of things. Shifting this puzzle piece out a bit, changing the layer of these sprites up and down, that sort of thing. Corey and I have been working closely together this week to try and make the elevators as fluid and useful as possible. So now there''s a brief delay after activation before they start moving, so you can still get on, but most importantly they now also move significantly faster if neither player is standing on them. Is it possible for this to be exploited for speed runs? Yes, but I''m not telling you exactly how.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>So that''s the week for Dyadic. Again, be sure to try out the demo and let us know what you think! You won''t regret it! Or you might. But if you do, make sure you let us know, so we can feel bad, but also so we can try to make the game better. And let us know if you don''t regret it too, that''s also a useful thing for us to know. Look, just play the game then tell us about it okay? Please? Cool, thanks.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Until next time,\r\n<br/>Jack', '2015-09-19 14:00:00'),
(18, 'Serious Business', 'Hello there, and welcome once more to this week''s Dyadic devlog! I''m Jack, Creative Director for Handsome Dragon games, and I shall be your guide through the magical world of "Recent Things That Have Been Happening Land". This week we''ll be looking at some new levels, a small web project we''ve begun working on, and a bit of important business stuff. So let''s dive right in.<br/><br/>Of course, we''ll start with my own area of expertise, the levels. Although, admittedly, this week I haven''t had all that much to do with them. The programmers, for lack of any particularly pressing programmer-y things to do, have been putting together the designs I made for the game''s first zone. As you''d expect, this zone is all about teaching the player how all of the mechanics in the game actually function, by slowly introducing them one by one. Well, not all of them, we''ll be saving some to introduce later, but the core ones will be in Zone 1.<br/><br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/Zone_1.PNG'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''><br/><i>It''s still in the early stages, but it''s coming along nicely. I''m a little surprised Corey can interpret my initial drawings though...</i></div><br/><br/>Some more official news, we''ve now managed to get everything in order to apply for our ABN! This means that before too long we''ll officially be a business and can finally start getting the demo - and later, the game - on Steam for you all! Unfortunately, it may still be up to a month before we can really get the process started, but that'' bureaucracy for you. Still, there''s exciting days ahead to be sure!<br/><br/>So, we''ve lately had plans to revamp our website quite a bit, and during one of our lengthy discussion on nothing in particular we came up with a silly idea. And well, long story short - we''ve decided to do it. We''re going to create a small ''Dragon Dressup'' game. It''s not going to be anything too flashy, but we''re going to give you the opportunity to give that Handsome looking dragon in our logo and equally Handsome new outfit. We''ve only just begun, so we''ve got no idea when we''re going to have the available for you, but not to worry, it''s coming. Eventually...<br/><br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/Dressed_Logo.jpg'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''><br/><i>A few of the possible additions you could make to this Handsome creature''s attire.</i></div><br/><br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/New_Logo.jpg'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''><br/><i>We''ve also tweaked the logo itself a bit this week! It''s looking better than ever!</i></div><br/><br/>Don''t go getting the wrong idea here. Dyadic is of course our top priority still. But making a little web game on the side is a refreshing change for us all. And it will hopefully give you something to do whilst you wait. Speaking of waiting, for those of you who are Mac and Linux users, unfortunately you''re going to have to wait a little while longer for the Demo, since we''re still working on sorting out the compatibility issues. How much longer, I can''t say. We''ll just have to wait and see...<br/><br/>Until next time,<br/>Jack', '2015-09-25 14:00:00'),
(19, 'Double Dragon', 'So, we''ve reached that time yet once more, the time for the Dyadic Devlog. Although, to be honest, it''s really more of a Dragon Devlog these days, since I talk about everything we''ve been doing, not just Dyadic. So hey, I think I''ll call it that from now on. But regardless of what we call this, I always have and (presumably) always will be Jack, (for now) Creative Director of Handsome Dragon Games. And I''m here to tell you what''s what when it comes to HDG''s recent activities.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Now, as many of you probably know, last weekend the team and I participated in the Brisbane 48hr Game Making Competition. We gave it our all and managed to make a game we''re all proud of (which I''ll talk more on later), and of course, we barely slept. So whilst there was time enough on Sunday to write a devlog, by that point we were all literally figuratively dead. Thus, I shall instead be covering two weeks'' worth of content in a single devlog, which will probably be longer than normal, but not too long. Anyway, enough preamble, let''s look at what''s been going on.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Firstly, let''s talk game jam. As I just mentioned, we recently made a game - start to finish - in a mere 48 hours. We titled the game "Emakimono", a Japanese word for ''painted scroll''. A name we chose since we drew a lot of inspiration from traditional Japanese artworks, and also had the entire game set within a painted scroll itself. Now, the game itself is an infinite auto-scroller that has players take control of a swallow which they then tilt up and down to fly over and under the various obstacles. Hitting these obstacles slows the player down and pushes them closer to the end of the scroll currently rolling itself up behind them, and closer to their demise. Care to give it a try? <a href=''http://bit.ly/1KZepRX''>You can get it here.</a>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/Emakimono.jpg'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''>\r\n<br/><i>A swallow desperately attempting to escape the collapse of its world...</i></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Somehow, within the 48 hours we actually managed to create a complete experience - music, art, mechanics - the lot. And as I''ve already said, we''re immensely happy with the way it all turned out. As such, we''ve decided that we''re going to later touch up the last few things we missed and release the game for mobile. Since it is rather small and has only two controls, it should play quite nicely on mobile. I just hope that you can still see everything well enough on such a small screen... When exactly we intend to release it is still up in air though. We may tweak it alongside Dyadic, or leave it until after Dyadic entirely. We''ll see, I suppose. If you want to read our audio man, Sam McLean''s view of the 48 hours, you can read his <a href=''http://bit.ly/1N7Ezos''>blog here.</a>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Now then, Dyadic stuff. We''re back into general production again, so there''s not too much exciting to talk about. I''m back to designing levels, and the programmers are assisting with putting them into the game, since there''s not too much left to do on the programming front (although Corey has been reworking the game''s audio system - it''s still a work in progress however). We''ve now got majority of the Zone 1 levels constructed. We still need to handle all of the decorating for those levels though, so there''s still a fair way to go there.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/Zone_1_Pic.jpg'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''>\r\n<br/><i>The beginning of a Zone 1 level, one of the few decorated place in Zone 1 so far.</i></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Beyond all that, we''ve also got more art coming in. In fact, very recently Angelica (our artist, for the forgetful amongst you) pointed out that we haven''t actually updated the look of our two protagonists, Huang and Lu, since the initial six week project. As such, she''s given them a make-over, and I must say it look exceptional. These aren''t the final designs, and there may still be some alterations to come, but they''re already looking better than ever.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/huang-and-lu_before.jpg'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''>\r\n<br/><i></i></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/huang-and-lu_now.jpg'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''>\r\n<br/><i>Huang and Lu are looking damn fine now.</i></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Alright, it''s probably about time I stop rambling on and on about things. Particularly since that covers all the notable events in Handsome Dragon Games'' recent history. Next week we''ll have more levels to show off, more art, and more updates in general. I''m looking forward to finding out what they are as much as you!\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Until next time,\r\n<br/>Jack', '2015-10-10 14:00:00'),

As always, I am Jack, Creative Director for Handsome Dragon Games, and I''m here to keep you up to date with all the happenings around these parts. To be fair though, as you may have guessed from the title, there aren''t many exciting happenings to talk about this week. But, let''s take a look anyway, shall we?\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/huang-and-lu_before.png'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''>\r\n<br/><i>Huang and Lu, looking extra fancy now.</i></div>\r\n<br/>\r\nFirst and undoubtedly foremost, as you may recall, our characters recently underwent a significant upgrade to their looks. And now that they''re looking better than ever. But, now that they''ve been redone, animations must be redone also. So over the last week that''s what Angelica''s been working on. Here''s a look at the new walk animation for player 1''s character ''Huang''.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/huang_walk_cycle_v1.gif'' width=''25%'' height=''25%''>\r\n<br/><i>Huang, looking sharp-eyed and determined to get that statue.</i></div>\r\n<br/>\r\nAlthough things haven''t been going entirely to plan with the new animations.

Now, as with a lot of programming things, it''s not something that I can really show you. Making a recording of the audio wouldn''t even help since the purpose of their work is not to change how the game actually sounds, but how it handles and plays all those sounds. But trust me when I say they''ve been working hard and making good progress.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Beyond that, design work is the same as ever. Designing new levels, and simply going through the various processes I described waaaaaay back in...what was it? Devlog 5 - By Process of Implementation, I believe. Once the new character animations are done, we''ll start getting some new environmental art in for the new zones, so I''ll have some nice, new, and interesting things to show you then. But until then, we can only wait.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Until next time,\r\n<br/>Jack', '2015-10-17 14:00:00'),
(21, 'Shirts''n''Stories', 'Hello, hello, and welcome back to the weekly Dyadic Devlog. As you''d expect (if you''ve read this before), I''m Jack, Creative Director for Handsome Dragon Games, here to let you know what''s been going on. Yet again, this week we''ve mostly been going through the motions (and will likely be continuing to do so for several weeks to come).So, as usual, we''re just pressing forward.<br/><br/>To delve into specifics, we''ll start with my area of expertise - Level Design (which I feel we haven''t done in a while). This week has a seen a couple of new designs join the ranks. Previously, we had designs for different parts of each different zone, however I can now say with confidence that we''ve completed all the designs for Zone 1, which leaves only about a third to go.<br/><br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/1-6_over_2.PNG'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''><br/><i>I''m not going to show you the whole level this time. Need to save some puzzle work for the actual game.</i></div><br/><br/>Majority of the first zone is designed to be simple and straight forward, so that players can understand how the core of the game functions. Although, these new levels are designed to be the first real test of the players - to see if they''ve actually learned anything during the previous ones. Difficulty curve is something that is exceptionally important to balance in any game, puzzle games in particular. It''s certainly something I''ve been keeping my eye on, and will have to do a lot of tests on to make sure I''ve got it right. But that''s a little later on.<br/><br/>Beyond the levels, we''ve also decided to spruce up the context of the game, and put in a lot of extra assets and events to really give the players a proper reason for pressing on through all the puzzles and challenges before them. Now, I''m not going to go into too much detail about the nature of the narrative that we''ve devised, because of spoilers and what not, but I will say this - The jade statue, otherwise known as ''The Jade Dragon''s Lullaby'' is going to be a lot more literal.<br/><br/>Aside from my work, Angelica has been doing more on the new character animations. We''ve got an awesome jump animation now, as well as some refinements on the walk animation. Meanwhile, the programmers have been continuing to redo the game''s audio system. And of course, Callan''s been PR-ing all over the place. Speaking of which, he''s recently started hosting an HDG live stream on Saturday over on our Twitch channel. So if you want to see he and Corey get their butts kicked in video games, be sure to check it out. I''ll be there sometimes too, to help the poor guys out.<br/><br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/huang_and_lu_jump_v2.gif'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''><br/><i>Ally-oop!</i></div><br/><br/>And that''s the round-up for the week! Oh, but one last non-game related piece of news, we now have Dyadic shirts! Though don''t get confused, we''re not selling them (yet). I quite literally mean we now have Dyadic shirts. So now we look like a team more than ever before! And hey, if you really do want one of these, let us know. If enough of you are on board, we might find a way to get you some! But either way, we''ll have to wait and see.<br/><br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/Shirt.JPG'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''><br/><i>It''s a really comfy shirt too.</i></div><br/><br/>Until next time,<br/>Jack', '2015-10-24 14:00:00'),
(22, 'Keeping Things Interesting', 'Hello, hello, and welcome back once more to the weekly Dyadic Devlog. If you''ve forgotten, or this is your first time here, I''m Jack, Creative Director for Handsome Dragon Games. Now, I''m going to be honest with you, this week we''ve all been pretty swamped with our studies, so we''ve made less progress than usual. On top of that, we''re also missing part of our team this weekend thanks to PAX. However, we have still made progress. And what''s more, to make up for all the things that I can''t talk about here because we haven''t got them done yet, I''ll be entertaining you with some of my design ramblings. Do enjoy.\r\n\r\nSo let''s start with some progress reports. Corey''s managed to get a virtual machine running, so he''s been doing some work testing out the Linux build of the game. We still haven''t nailed down where all the issues are coming from, but we''re working on it. Hopefully this means we''ll be able to finally get a Linux build out for all of you Linux users out there, far later than we''d hoped, I know. But hopefully soon, and by ''soon'', I mean some time in the future that probably isn''t as soon as you''d like it to be.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/Linux_Issues.png'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''>\r\n<br/><i>Corey''s virtual machines works, although not quite how he wants it.</i></div>\r\n<br/>\r\nBeyond that we''ve been working our way through completing the new character animations, creating new level designs, and the ever wonderful Sam McLean has emerged from stasis to begin experimenting with some new music tracks for us! And with any luck, we''ll soon be able to properly start ironing out the kinks in the game''s Mac build too. If we can find where any the kinks are, that is.\r\n\r\nSo that''s where the game is at, and this is where the rambling starts up. As I mentioned earlier, I''ve been putting together a series of new designs for the various levels and puzzles in the game. This has all been going well and dandy, but recently I spotted an issue with the way the levels came together as a whole. Whilst there was plenty of variation in the types of pieces in each puzzle and the way there were put together, there were almost no variations in how the players interacted with the level. Always one player on one side, one player on the other; solving puzzles back and forth until you escape.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/1-6_Snippet.png'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''>\r\n<br/><i>A section of the final level of the first zone. It''ll test if you''ve actually learned anything.</i></div>\r\n<br/>\r\nWhilst we can certainly provide various levels of difficulty to create a degree of pacing and flow in the game, the nature of the gameplay remains very much the same throughout most of the experience. This revelation came roughly alongside the time we decided to beef up the context of the game, as I discussed last week, and I must say these two coming together has given me some excellent ideas.\r\n\r\nNow, the first and simplest way to change up the puzzle (which I would have done regardless of how we''ve shifted the game''s premise) is to do away with the split puzzles for a time. No longer are you and your partner divided by the dark, impenetrable walls, but rather you are standing together, face to face. Naturally, having to work in the same space as your partner changes the dynamic significantly. Any traps you intend to spring may take you out as well, and the very nature by which you must go about solving puzzles shifts, as you now have a second self-moving (well, in a sense) piece to work with.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/><div class=''align''><img src=''http://media.indiedb.com/images/members/4/3258/3257618/profile/2-1_Snippet.png'' width=''50%'' height=''50%''>\r\n<br/><i>A section of a two-in-one level.</i></div>\r\n<br/>\r\nAdditionally, we''re looking at making certain levels much more dynamic. Now, I don''t want to give away too much about what we''re doing with the game''s underlying story of sorts, but I will say this - these ruins are not exactly the most structurally sound place in the world. Should something of...considerable size happen to cause tremors in the area, well, let''s just say the landscape might change quite drastically. Aside from probably looking really cool, this also shakes things up a bit by suddenly switching out the puzzle the players thought they had to solve with another, keeping them on their toes.\r\n\r\nFinally, we''re looking at adding a section or two designed to test just how quickly you can solve puzzles and keep moving ahead. Now, I''ve left this one to last because it''s the one we''re least sure on how it''s going to work exactly, because it doesn''t really fit with the current death system. The current system has very little penalty for death aside from being sent back a ways to the last checkpoint, and send the statue to your friend/opponent if you had it with you. We''re going to have to find some interesting ways around this, and I''m sure we will.\r\n\r\nAnyway, that''s enough rambling from me today. One last note before I leave you be though: it was recommended to Corey (who is currently down at PAX in Melbourne) that we get ourselves our own booth down there next year. Now, we''re all very keen on the idea, but obviously it''s a long time away and will take a considerable amount of effort to actually do, so don''t go getting too excited about it. But, I simply wanted to say that it''s on the table. We may end up there, we may not. It seems only time shall tell...\r\n\r\nUntil next time,\r\nJack', '2015-10-31 14:00:00');
